# Us-Housing-Analysis
Based on certain data of US housing sales factors and prediction was made


# About the analysis done on dataset
First in all the columns was preprocess like checking for duplicates, null values, etc. then analysis done on majority of the common things which have drastic changes in the sales price.
And at the end for better conclusion a heatmap was used in order tocheck all the factors(or columns) which are correlated to the Sales price.
Based on the dataset provided we can say that only few columns shows correlation above '0.5'

The dataset here has some dummy variables assumptions in order to create a trend as only the year sold was not sufficient for prediction of trends and seasonalities we have to generate some dummy data in order to create timestamp.
Due to which the trend didn't come out great but we can see some seasonality here.
